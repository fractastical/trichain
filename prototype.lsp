;;; 2. Lisp or Python AI system that interfaces with the C++ code
;;; 3. RPC interface for the AI to interact with the running node
;;; 4. Automated test suite that allows the Red AI to attack safely
;;; 5. Security patch generation and application system
;;; 6. Version control integration for the developer commits

;;; Implementation Steps to Convert Conceptual Model to Working System:
;;; 1. Create a Bitcoin fork with minimal changes to prove concept
;;; 2. Add AI interface hooks to key security components
;;; 3. Implement the AI models using modern ML frameworks
;;; 4. Create a testnet environment for safe red-teaming
;;; 5. Develop the secure patch application process
;;; 6. Automate the evolution cycle
