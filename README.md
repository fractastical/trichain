Today I was contemplating as a test a deployment framework where a sufficiently intelligent AI creates a blockchain of the simplest version and, at the same time, instantiates a "red" AI that then works to exploit that application and where a set of keys is held by the "core developer" who then committed changes back to the first version. 

The highly unproven thesis is that even in a weak crypto circumstance the iterative red-team embedded solution would outcompete existing infrastructures by creating a strong internal incentive towards transparent exploitation which then in turn would create a rapid improvement in the overall infrastructure such that the combined "trichain" would out compete any other comparable product.

It also would be unique in training multiple AIs at the same time specifically to the point of creating an evolving but secure infrastructure.
