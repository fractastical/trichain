;;; Implementation Notes for Real System

;; 1. LLM Isolation Strategy:
;;    - Each LLM gets a unique, restricted prompt that does not mention other LLMs
;;    - Information passes through dispatcher that filters content
;;    - No LLM has access to the overall system architecture
;;    - The dispatcher rewrites outputs to remove any indicators of source

;; 2. Role-Based Access Control:
;;    - Each LLM has a specific capability scope and designated responsibilities
;;    - Information is compartmentalized with need-to-know principle
;;    - Security boundaries prevent knowledge transfer between agents

;; 3. Real Implementation Approach:
;;    - Deploy each LLM as a separate service with API access only
;;    - Use embeddings to create specific knowledge domains
;;    - Implement request/response filtering in the dispatcher
;;    - Create domain-specific context for each LLM
